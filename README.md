  <strong>Hi, I'm desanterre ðŸ‘‹</strong>
</p>

<p align="center">
  I work at <strong>Ubisoft</strong> as a full stack developer.<br>
  
  My main focus is building cloud products and maintaining the internal cloud systems that power Ubisoft's infrastructure.<br>
  I love working close to the metal, automating workflows, and making sure things run smoothly at scale.<br>
  Most of my days are spent in <code>nvim</code>, scripting, breaking things (on purpose), and patching up the aftermath.<br>
  Terminal > UI, always.<br>
  Currently building a Hackintosh on an HP Spectre x360 just to see how far I can push my patience.

## Current Projects

- **CHZ Nexus Bot**  
  A WebSocket automation bot for [chapatiz.com](https://www.chapatiz.com), powered by `FastAPI` and `asyncio`.  
  Handles real-time chat parsing, logs, and can emulate visitor chat â€” eventually with full user login support.  
  Has a control panel via FastAPI UI (`/docs`), terminal interface, and logs live activity.  
  Future plans:
  - Real user authentication
  - Automatic reactions / chatbot logic
  - Room teleportation
  - Full UI for anyone to connect as guest or user
  - AI integration 

- **Hackintosh on HP Spectre x360**  
  Because why not put macOS on a tablet-laptop hybrid and lose sleep.
